## Math Simple Express Server

Make sure yarn is installed. Using brew is easiest:

`brew install yarn`

Next, install all dependencies using yarn:

`yarn`

Once all dependencies are installed, run the server using the following command:

`yarn start`

Unless otherwise specified, server will be running at http://localhost:8080
